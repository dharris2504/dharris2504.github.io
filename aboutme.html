<h1>This page is all about my past</h1>

<p>I grew up a military kid and was born in Lewiston, Maine but moved to New York when I was very young. I went to a few different schools in New York but ended up graduating from Carthage High School in Carthage, New York. I was a 3 sport athlete throughout high school.</p>
